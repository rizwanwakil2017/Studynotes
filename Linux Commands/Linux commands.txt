What is Shell
	The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out. 
	Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash. 
	The name “bash” is an acronym for “Bourne Again Shell”
	
Teminal
	Terminal is used to access the Shell to enter the commands

Terminal Lunch
	When we first log in to our system our current working directory is set to our home directory.
	After terminal lunch, we should see prompt like below
	username@computer_name:pwd$
	it will usually include your username@machinename, followed by the current working
	directory and a dollar sign if normal user or # sign for root user.
	
	after the $ sign we will enter linux commands.

Navigation commands			
	above commands under Navigation commands section are used to navigate the file system on Linux system. Linux system organize its files in 
	tree structure called hierarchi directory structure.
	the first directory in file system is called root directory, represented by (/). root directory contains sub directories and files.
	
	Note:
		Linux files system have single files structure for each storage device unlike windows operating system which have seperate FS for each storage
		device (harddisk partition). 
		In Linux storage device are attached or mount at various points in file system.
		
	Changing Working Directory
		to change the directory, we use cd command followed by pathname. pathname can be classified in two ways
			1.	absoulate pathname		complete the pathname starting from root directory and pointing to PWD. like /usr/bin/
			2.	relative pathname		start from working directory. To do this, we use . and .. symbols. the . symbol represent current directory
										while .. symbol represent working directory's parent directory
	Listing files and Directories with ls -l command
		-rwx rwx rwx 			first - represent normal file, if it's d means directory, if it's l mean link file
								first three charecters (rwx) represent file owner rights
								second three charecters (rwx) represent group rights
								third three charecters (rwx) represent everyone rights
								
Working on Files & Directories
	Wildcards
			*				Match any charecter
			?				Match any single charecter
			[charecter]		Match any charecter members of charecters
			[!charecters]	oposite of above
			[[:class:]]
			
			classs = [:alnum:] or [:alpha:] or [:digit:] or [:lower:] or [:upper:]
			
	creating hard link 
		ln -s file link		(command syntex)
		ln -s file_name link_name
		
Creating Play Ground
	create a directory with name playground in home directory using mkdir command and create two more directories dir1 and dir2 inside playground
	copy passwd file from etc directory to playground directory
