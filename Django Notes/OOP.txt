What is Object
	a tengible thing that we can touch, sense , feel and munipulate is called object
	collection of data and associated behaviours is called object

Class
	class describe objects. they are blue print for creating objects
	
Attribute or Memebers
	data in class is called attribute or memembers
	
Methode or Functions
	behaviours are represented by methods in class

Encapsulation or Information Hiding
	the processing of hiding the implementation or functional detail is called Encapsulation or Information Hiding

Abstraction
	
Composition
	composition is act of collecting several objects togather to create new one is called composition
	
Inheritance
	Inheritance is a fom of family tree.
	
Multiple Inheritance


Polymorphism
	
	

Creating Class
	class MyFirstClass:
		pass

Creating Object of above class from interactive mode
	run the following command from command prompt
		python -i class.py
		a = MyFirstClass()
		b = MyFirstClass()
		print(a)
		print(b)
		
Adding Attribute to class
	class Point:
		pass
		
	p1 = Point()
	p2 = Point()
	
	p1.x = 5
	p1.y = 4
	
	p2.x = 3
	p2.y = 6
	
	
	
	
	



class Point:
	def __init__(self, x=0 , y=0 ):		# constructor
		self.x = x
		self.y = y
		or 
		self.move(x, y)
		
		
	def reset(self):
		self.x = 0
		self.y = 0
	def move(self, x , y);
		self.x = x
		self.y = y
		
	def calc_distance(self, other_obj2):
		return math.sqrt(
			(self.x - other_obj2.x)**2 + (self.y - other_obj2.y)**2
		)
		

#  creating class objects

obj1 = Piont()

obj1.x = 10
obj1.y = 20

print(obj1.x, obj1.y)

obj1.function_name()

print(obj1.x, obj1.y)
